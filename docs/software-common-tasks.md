# Common Software Tasks


## Password-Free Access

For password free access to the Orin, follow these steps: 

1. Ensure that you have an SSH key in ~/.ssh 
2. With the USB connected, run `ssh-copy-id lis@192.168.55.1`
3. Make sure that the ssh-agent is on: ``eval `ssh-agent` `` 
4. Add your key to the agent: `ssh-add`
5. Ensure that you can access the device without a password: `ssh lis@192.168.55.1`


## Wi-Fi Setup

SSH into the Orin. The following is a reference for commands that you can use with `nmcli`: 

To see available Wi-Fi networks: `nmcli device wifi list`

To connect to a network with simple auth (open or WPA2/WPA3 password): `sudo nmtui` -> Activate Connection

To connect to a more complicated network (eduroam/epfl): 
```bash
sudo nmcli connection add type wifi \
con-name "epfl" \
ssid "epfl" \
wifi-sec.key-mgmt wpa-eap \
802-1x.eap ttls \
802-1x.phase2-auth mschapv2 \
802-1x.identity "YourUsername" \
802-1x.password "YourPassword" \
802-11-wireless.bssid "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"
```

Replace YourUsername, YourPassword with your GASPAR credentials. You can find the bssid of your local router by `nmcli device wifi list`. Use that instead of `AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF`.
