# Remote Control Setup

We use the Taranis Remote Control. Download the latest version of OpenTX for your RC from [their website](https://www.open-tx.org/downloads). To install it, unzip the files into the root directory of the MicroSD card, and plug the MicroSD card into the slot in the RC. The slot is above the battery. 

Ensure the TBX Nano RX is plugged into the RC slot on the flight controller. Plug in the TBS Micro TX into the controller.
